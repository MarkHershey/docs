# Vim Reference

## Modes

- **Normal**: for moving around a file and making edits
- **Insert**: for inserting text
- **Replace**: for replacing text
- **Visual** (plain, line, or block) mode: for selecting blocks of text
- **Command-line**: for running a command

You change modes by pressing `<ESC>` (the escape key) to switch from any mode
back to normal mode. From normal mode, enter insert mode with `i`, replace mode
with `R`, visual mode with `v`, visual line mode with `V`, visual block mode
with `<C-v>` (Ctrl-V, sometimes also written `^V`), and command-line mode with
`:`.

You use the `<ESC>` key a lot when using Vim: consider remapping Caps Lock to
Escape ([macOS
instructions](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Map_caps_lock_to_escape_in_macOS)).

## Command-line

Command mode can be entered by typing `:` in normal mode. Your cursor will jump
to the command line at the bottom of the screen upon pressing `:`. This mode
has many functionalities, including opening, saving, and closing files, and
[quitting Vim](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/435555976687923200).

- `:q` quit vim (close window)
- `:w` save file (write file)
- `:wq` save and quit
- `:e {name of file}` open file for editing
- `:ls` show open buffers
- `:help {topic}` open help
    - `:help :w` opens help for the `:w` command
    - `:help w` opens help for the `w` movement

## Movement

You should spend most of your time in normal mode, using movement commands to
navigate the buffer. Movements in Vim are also called "nouns", because they
refer to chunks of text.

- Basic movement: `h` `j` `k` `l` (left, down, up, right)
- Words: `w` (next word), `b` (beginning of word), `e` (end of word)
- Lines: `0` (beginning of line), `^` (first non-blank character), `$` (end of line)
- Screen: `H` (top of screen), `M` (middle of screen), `L` (bottom of screen)
- Scroll: `Ctrl-u` (up), `Ctrl-d` (down)
- File: `gg` (beginning of file), `G` (end of file)
- Line numbers: `:{number}<CR>` or `{number}G` (line {number})
- Misc: `%` (corresponding item)
- Find: `f{character}`, `t{character}`, `F{character}`, `T{character}`
    - find/to forward/backward {character} on the current line
    - `,` / `;` for navigating matches
- Search: `/{regex}`, `n` / `N` for navigating matches

## Edits

Everything that you used to do with the mouse, you now do with the keyboard
using editing commands that compose with movement commands. Here's where Vim's
interface starts to look like a programming language. Vim's editing commands
are also called "verbs", because verbs act on nouns.

- `i` enter insert mode
    - but for manipulating/deleting text, want to use something more than
    backspace
- `o` / `O` insert line below / above
- `d{motion}` delete {motion}
    - e.g. `dw` is delete word, `d$` is delete to end of line, `d0` is delete
    to beginning of line
- `c{motion}` change {motion}
    - e.g. `cw` is change word
    - like `d{motion}` followed by `i`
- `x` delete character (equal do `dl`)
- `s` substitute character (equal to `xi`)
- visual mode + manipulation
    - select text, `d` to delete it or `c` to change it
- `u` to undo, `<C-r>` to redo
- `y` to copy / "yank" (some other commands like `d` also copy)
- `p` to paste
- Lots more to learn: e.g. `~` flips the case of a character

## Counts

You can combine nouns and verbs with a count, which will perform a given action
a number of times.

- `3w` move 3 words forward
- `5j` move 5 lines down
- `7dw` delete 7 words

## Modifiers

You can use modifiers to change the meaning of a noun. Some modifiers are `i`,
which means "inner" or "inside", and `a`, which means "around".

- `ci(` change the contents inside the current pair of parentheses
- `ci[` change the contents inside the current pair of square brackets
- `da'` delete a single-quoted string, including the surrounding single quotes
