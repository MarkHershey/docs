# Types of Machine Learning 

## Supervised Learning

- Classification 
    - classify discrete values, predict discrete categories
- Regression
    - predict continuous values

## Unsupervised Learning

- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
    - [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)
    - [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding)

## Semi-supervised Learning

Use a small subset of labelled data with a large amount of unlabelled data for learning.

## Reinforcement Learning

- Q-learning
- SARSA
