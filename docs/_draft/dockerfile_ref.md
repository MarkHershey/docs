## Work with Dockerfile

### `FROM`
the base image to build on top of.
```
FROM [image:tag]
```

Usually the recommended distribution of a linux system to use a base is `Alpine`.
- `Alpine` is a minimal Docker image based on Alpine Linux with a complete package index and only 5 MB in size!


### `LABEL`
### `WORKDIR`

```
WORKDIR /path/to/workdir
```

The `WORKDIR` instruction sets the working directory for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY` and `ADD` instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile. If the `WORKDIR` doesn’t exist, it will be created even if it’s not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.

### `RUN`
### `CMD`
### `EXPOSE`
### `VOLUME`

```
VOLUME ["/data"]
```

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.


### `ENV`
### `ARG`
### `COPY`

```
COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>
or
COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] ["<src>",... "<dest>"]
```

The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>.

### `ADD`
### `ENTRYPOINT`
```
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
```
You can use the exec form of `ENTRYPOINT` to set fairly stable default commands and arguments and then use either form of `CMD` to set additional defaults that are more likely to be changed.
