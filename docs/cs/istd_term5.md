    === "Learning Objectives"

        - Design medium-scale software system from scratch: formulating and analyzing the problem to be solved; writing formal software requirements, exploring and formulating system designs; and using extensive and systematic testing and reasoning to ensure quality.
        - Apply key software engineering ideas, including invariants, decoupling, and data abstraction.
        - Apply key software engineering ideas, including software design, specification, abstraction, verification and correctness.
        - Apply widely used design concepts and notations (UML diagrams) and patterns in exploring and articulating problems and designs.
        - Learning effective techniques on ensuring quality of large-scale software systems.
        - Apply concepts of systematic software testing to discover bugs (including security vulnerabilities) in large-scale software systems.
        - Apply concepts to reason about the security loopholes in software systems.
        - Learning secure software coding standards.
        - Learning key concepts in developing concurrent programs.
        - Learning key concepts in reasoning and testing concurrent programs.
